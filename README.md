# 100 React Websites

This challenge is similar to the 100 Days of Code challenge but will focus on creating and developing 100 different React websites/ web applications.

The first xx amount of websites will be from tutorials found across YouTube, Udemy, and other various programming channels and mediums. Once exhauasting the tutorial route, the developer should start building web apps from scratch.

The goal is to understand React better from a foundational perspective and see how it can be implemented with other various technologies. It will NOT solely focus on the MERN stack but with encompass all other technologies to see how React is being used.

The idea is that after xx amount of websites, the developer no longer needs tutorials and has safely escaped from Tutorial Hell. Once the developer has comfort in building apps from the scratch, the developer should move onto other areas of development whether it's the backend, design, testing, containerization, microservices, etc. There is no specific route for the developer to follow. Follow whichever path that suits you best.

Update on this challenge:

* It does not have to be 100 websites/apps per day. Some larger full stack apps will take more than 1 day to complete.
* However, the developer should maintain daily coding practices.
* Shorter component driven tutorials are acceptable as long as they are later implemented over to full websites and applications. Smaller tuts mean you should do a little bit more coding that day :)
* It is not necessary to host all the smaller projects on heroku, netlify, etc. as there are limit restrictions. Host only what you feel is a significant project, which will most likely be apps as you get closer to the 100 mark.
* Remember, incremental progresss everyday is like compound interest in finance, a little bit adds up to a lot over time. We'll call it compound progress and this is a way to compound
* There will be more updates as this challenge grows and progresses.
